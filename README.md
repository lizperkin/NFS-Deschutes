# NFS-Deschutes
Data from USGS Gauges on the Deschutes &amp; code for figures

All code is located in "R" folder
Figures I have created from data are in "Figures" folder
Data files are in "Data" folder, but I was not careful about my workflow & didn't keep it all in R, 
so beware that data you download with the "DeschutesTemp.R" code will be in a slightly different format than the data used in "SWW Temp Graphs.R"

Please contact me with any questions you might have: liz@nativefishsociety.org
